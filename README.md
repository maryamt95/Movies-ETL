# Movies-ETL

## Background and Purpose
After working with collegue at Amazing Prime, in preparation for a hackathon to connect Amazing Prime with local coding community and hoping to gain insights on which low budget movies will become popullar, a continuation of the project developes to automate the ETL pipeline.

Simply put, we

* Extracted relevant datasets from Wikipedia and Kaggle
* Transformed those datasets for our needs (joining them, and cleaning up variables, etc.)
* And finally, we loaded into Pogres SQL database by making the clean data sets ready to be queried in tables there
